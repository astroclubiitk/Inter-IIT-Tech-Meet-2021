0,A machine learning approach for classification of accretion states of black hole binaries,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1334S,"['IGR J17091-3624', 'MAXI J1535-571', 'GX 339-4', 'XTE J1859+226']","Sreehari, H., & Nandi, A.","accretion, accretion disc, black hole physics, methods: data analysis, X-rays: binaries, Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","In this paper, we employ Machine Learning algorithms on multimission observations for the classification of accretion states of outbursting black hole X-ray binaries for the first time. Archival data from RXTE, Swift, MAXI, and AstroSat observatories are used to generate the hardness intensity diagrams (HIDs) for outbursts of the sources XTE J1859+226 (1999 outburst), GX 339-4 (2002, 2004, 2007, and 2010 outbursts), IGR J17091-3624 (2016 outburst), and MAXI J1535-571 (2017 outburst). Based on variation of X-ray flux, hardness ratios, presence of various types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), photon indices, and disc temperature, we apply clustering algorithms like K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering to classify the accretion states (clusters) of each outburst. As multiple parameters are involved in the classification process, we show that clustering algorithms club together the observations of similar characteristics more efficiently than the 'standard' method of classification. We also infer that K-Means clustering provides more reliable results than Hierarchical clustering. We demonstrate the importance of the classification based on machine learning by comparing it with results from 'standard' classification."

We confirmed the cluster membership of the extracted sources using Gaia data release 2 (Gaia DR2) proper motion data. We have used colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) using UVIT and GAIA filters to separate out different evolutionary stages of the stars present in the cluster. We have identified a new extreme horizontal branch (EHB) star at the core of the cluster using UV and UV-optical CMDs. The estimated distance modulus of the cluster is 16.95 ± 0.05 obtained by fitting BaSTI isochrones with cluster parameters, [Fe/H] = -1.8 dex and age =12.0 Gyr on the V - I versus V CMD. Interestingly, only the EHB star and blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs) among the UV-bright hot sources are detected in FUV filters of UVIT. We have derived the effective temperature of BHBs using colour-temperature relation and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of multiband filters, which are in the range from 8000 to 10 500 K. We find a variation of He abundance of BHBs by fitting the BaSTI ZAHB (zero-age horizontal branch). The range in the He abundance of the BHBs corresponding to the best-fitting isochrones is from 0.247 to 0.350. We have estimated various physical parameters of the newly identified EHB star in the cluster using SED fit and post-HB evolutionary tracks. We have studied the radial distribution of all the sources of the cluster detected in UVIT. The sources detected in FUV filters extend beyond the half-light radius (1.15 arcmin) of the cluster, whereas the sources detected in NUV filters extend beyond the tidal radius (9.2 arcmin) of the cluster."

In this paper, we report the results of ˜125 ks AstroSat observations of this source during the 2016 outburst. For the first time, a double-peaked QPO (DPQ) is detected in a few time segments of this source with a difference of δf ˜ 12 mHz between the two peaks. The nature of the DPQ was studied based on hardness ratios and using the static as well as the dynamic power spectrum. Additionally, a low-frequency (25-48 mHz) 'heartbeat' single-peak QPO (SPQ) was observed at different intervals of time along with harmonics (50-95 mHz). Broad-band spectra in the range 0.7-23 keV, obtained with Soft X-ray Telescope and Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter, could be fitted well with combination of a thermal Comptonization and a multicolour disc component model. During AstroSat observation, the source was in the soft-intermediate state (SIMS) as observed with Swift/XRT. We present a comparative study of the 'heartbeat' state variability in IGR J17091-3624 with GRS 1915 + 105. Significant difference in the timing properties is observed although spectral parameters (Γ ˜ 2.1-2.4 and T<SUB>max</SUB> ˜ 0.6-0.8 keV) in the broad energy band remain similar. Spectral properties of segments exhibiting SPQ and DPQ are further studied using simple phase-resolved spectroscopy which does not show a significant difference. Based on the model parameters, we obtain the maximum ratio of mass accretion rate in GRS 1915 + 105 to that in IGR J17091-3624 as ˜25: 1. We discuss the implications of our findings and comment on the physical origin of these exotic variabilities."

We examine the temporal properties of both sources and obtain fractional rms variability of power density spectrum in the frequency range 0.002-10 Hz to be ${\sim}9{}-17{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for LMC X-1, and ${\sim}7{}-11{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for LMC X-3. The 'spectro-temporal' properties indicate both sources are in thermally dominated soft state.

We also constrain the spin of LMC X-1 to be in the range 0.82-0.92 and that of LMC X-3 in 0.22-0.41 with 90 per cent confidence.

We carry out an energy resolved burst profile analysis as well as time resolved spectral analysis for each of the bursts and characterize their properties. All bursts are weak with burst peak-to-persistent intensity ratios < 3, decay times ~ 1.2 s, and with fluences ~ 1 ×10<SUP>-8</SUP> ergs/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, indicating that the observed bursts are Helium fuelled flashes. An evolution of the blackbody temperature and radius is also observed during each burst. We carry out a search for Burst Oscillations (BO) and derive upper limits to the rms fractional amplitude for BO (for all the bursts) to be ~ 1%. We also carried out search for Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the power density spectra and we obtain upper limits to the fractional rms amplitude as ~ 3.4% at frequencies close to ~ 5.6 Hz. We further carry out spectral and timing analysis of the non-burst persistent emission along with a study of the hardness-intensity and colour-colour diagrams. Using results from our analysis we infer that during this observation in 2016, Cyg X-2 can be characterized as being in the early Flaring Branch (FB) with a puffed up accretion disk and a clumpy coronal structure while undergoing medium-to-high levels of accretion."

We found that extension of the RC is an intrinsic property of the cluster and it is not due to contamination of field stars or differential reddening across the field. We studied the spectral energy distribution of the RC stars, and estimated a small range in temperature ∼5000-5500 K, luminosity ∼60-90 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radius ∼8.0-11.0 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> supporting their RC nature. The range of UV magnitudes amongst the RC stars (∼23.3 to 24.8 mag) is likely caused by the combined effects of variable mass loss, variation in initial helium abundance (Y<SUB>ini</SUB> = 0.23 to 0.28), and a small variation in age (6.5-7.5 Gyr) and metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.5 to -1.3).

We detected the full horizontal branch (HB) in the NUV and blue HB in the FUV and identified two extreme HB (EHB) stars. HB stars have a tight sequence in UV-optical CMDs, well fitted with isochrones generated (age 12.6 Gyr, [Fe/H] = -1.27 metallicity) using updated BaSTI-IAC models. Effective temperatures (T<SUB>eff</SUB>), luminosities, and radii of bright HB stars were estimated using the spectral energy distribution. As we detect the complete sample of UV-bright HB stars, the hot end of the HB distribution is found to terminate at the G-jump ( $T_{\rm eff}\, \sim$ 11500 K). The two EHB stars, fitted well with single spectra, have T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 31000 K and a mass = 0.495 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and follow the same T<SUB>eff</SUB>-radius relation as the blue HB stars.

We constructed the UV and UV-optical color-magnitude diagrams, compared the horizontal branch (HB) members with the theoretical zero- and terminal-age HB models, and identified 34 UV-bright stars. The spectral energy distributions of the UV-bright stars were fitted with theoretical models to estimate their effective temperatures (12,500-100,000 K), radii (0.13-2.2 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>), and luminosities (∼40-3000 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) for the first time. These stars were then placed on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, along with theoretical post-HB evolutionary tracks, to assess their evolutionary status.

We also calculated the theoretically expected number of hot post-(early)-AGB stars in this cluster and found the range to match our observations.

The deep narrow-band image reveals a very pertubed ionised gas distribution that is characterised by a prominent banana-shaped structure in the front of the galaxy formed of giant HII regions crossing the stellar disc. Star-forming structures, at ∼8 kpc from the edges of the stellar disc, are also detected in a deep far-ultraviolet ASTROSAT/UVIT image. This particular morphology indicates that the galaxy is undergoing an almost edge-on ram pressure stripping event. The same Hα+[NII] image also shows that the star formation activity is totally quenched in the leading edge of the disc, where the gas has been removed during the interaction with the surrounding medium. The spectral energy distribution fitting analysis of the multi-frequency data indicates that this quenching episode is very recent (∼50 Myr), and roughly corresponds to an increase of the star formation activity by a factor of ∼161% in the inner regions with respect to that expected for secular evolution. The analysis of these data, whose angular resolution enables the study of the induced effects of the perturbation down to the scale of individual HII regions (r<SUB>eq</SUB> ≃ 40 pc), also suggests that the increase of star formation activity is due to the compression of the gas along the stellar disc of the galaxy, which is able to increase its mean electron density and boost the star formation process producing bright HII regions with luminosities up to L(Hα) ≃ 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of the VESTIGE data with deep IFU spectroscopy gathered with MUSE and with high spectral resolution Fabry Perot data also indicates that the hydrodynamic interaction has deeply perturbed the velocity field of the ionised gas component while leaving that of the stellar disc unaffected. The comparison of the data with tuned high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations accounting for the different gas phases (atomic, molecular, ionised) consistently indicates that the perturbing event is very recent (50-150 Myr), once again confirming that ram pressure stripping is a violent phenomenon that is able to perturb the evolution of galaxies in rich environments on short timescales."

This technique is robust, reproducible and versatile in various cluster environments. In this study, the Gaia EDR3 membership catalogues are provided along with classification of the stars as members, candidates and field in the six clusters.

The first observing run, 8.1-9.9 d after the outburst, initially showed a stable intensity level with a hard X-ray spectrum that we attribute to shocks between the nova ejecta and the pre-existing stellar companion. On day 8.57, the first, weak, signs appeared of supersoft source (SSS) emission powered by residual burning on the surface of the white dwarf. The SSS emission was observed to be highly variable on time-scales of hours. After day 8.9, the SSS component was more stable and brighter. In the second observing run, on days 15.9-19.6 after the outburst, the SSS component was even brighter but still highly variable. The SSS emission was observed to fade significantly during days 16.8-17.8 followed by re-brightening. Meanwhile, the shock component was stable, leading to increase in hardness ratio during the period of fading. AstroSat and XMM-Newton observations have been used to study the spectral properties of V3890 Sgr to draw quantitative conclusions even if their drawback is model dependent. We used the XSPEC to fit spectral models of plasma emission, and the best fits are consistent with the elemental abundances being lower during the second observing run compared to the first for spectra ≥1 keV. The SSS emission is well fitted by non-local thermal equilibrium model atmosphere used for white dwarfs. The resulting spectral parameters, however, are subject to systematic uncertainties such as completeness of atomic data."

The star does not display, in low-resolution optical spectra, the high excitation lines typically seen in the spectra of symbiotic stars. In this work, ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared observations are presented, aimed at exploring and strengthening the proposed symbiotic classification for this star. Our far-UV 1300-1800 Å spectrum of SU Lyn, obtained with the ASTROSAT mission's UVIT payload, shows emission lines of Si iv, C iv, O iii, and N iii in a spectrum typical of symbiotic stars. The UV spectrum robustly confirms SU Lyn's symbiotic nature. The detection of high excitation lines in a high-resolution optical spectrum further consolidates its symbiotic nature. As is being recognized, the potential existence of other similar symbiotic systems could significantly impact the census of symbiotic stars in the Galaxy."

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the upgraded Giant Meter Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Mrk 212 has two previously known radio sources associated with the two optical nuclei, S1 and S2, with a projected separation of ∼6 kpc, making it a dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidate. Our new 15-GHz VLA observations reveal that S1 is a double radio source centred around the optical nucleus; its total extent is ∼750 pc its average 1.4-8.5 GHz spectral index is -0.81 ± 0.06. S1 therefore resembles a compact symmetric object. The 15-GHz VLA image identifies the radio source at S2 to be a compact core. Our radio observations therefore strongly support the presence of a dual AGN in Mrk 212. The optical emission line flux ratios obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) observations however, show that S1 and S2 both fall in the AGN + star formation (SF) region of the Baldwin, Philips and Terlevich (BPT) diagram. Weak AGN lying in the SF or AGN + SF intermediate regions in the BPT diagram have indeed been reported in the literature; our sources clearly fall in the same category. We find an extended radio structure in our newly reduced 8.5-GHz-VLA data, that is offset by ∼1 arcsec from the optical nucleus S2. New deep FUV and NUV observations with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope aboard AstroSat reveal SF knots around S2 as well as kpc-scale tidal tails; the SF knots around S2 coincide with the extended radio structure detected at 8.5 GHz. The radio spectral indices are consistent with SF. Any possible association with the AGN in S2 is unclear at this stage."

Broad-band SED modelling using γ-ray data from Fermi-Large Area Telescope, X-ray data from Swift-XRT and AstroSat, and UV-optical data from Swift-UVOT, AstroSat, and Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey was carried out at seven different epochs, including three γ-ray flaring episodes and four quiescent periods (three long-term averaged ones and one during AstroSat observing period). Our SED modelling suggests that two compact emission regions originating at a different time outside the broad-line region and moving away from the core with variation primarily in the jet electron spectra can explain the emission from the high-, moderate-, and low-activity periods. The emissions from high- and first low-activity states are likely to have originated in the first region. The moderate- and second low-activity states are likely due to the second emission region with fresh particle acceleration/injection at a later time."

The colour-colour diagram indicates a variability class of δ with the detection of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) in the power density spectra. The HFQPO is seen to vary in the frequency range of 67.96-70.62 Hz with percentage rms ∼0.83-1.90 per cent and significance varying from 1.63 to 7.75. The energy dependent power spectra show that the HFQPO features are dominant only in 6-25 keV energy band. The broad-band energy spectra (0.7-50 keV) of Soft X-ray Telescope and Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter modelled with nthComp and powerlaw imply that the source has an extended corona in addition to a compact 'Comptonizing corona' that produces high-energy emission and exhibits HFQPOs. The broad-band spectral modelling indicates that the source spectra are well described by thermal Comptonization with electron temperature (kT<SUB>e</SUB>) of 2.07-2.43 keV and photon index (Γ<SUB>nth</SUB>) between 1.73 and 2.45 with an additional powerlaw component of photon index (Γ<SUB>PL</SUB>) between 2.94 and 3.28. The norm of nthComp component is high (∼8) during the presence of strong HFQPO and low (∼3) during the absence of HFQPO. Further, we model the energy spectra with the kerrbb model to estimate the accretion rate, mass, and spin of the source. Our findings indicate that the source accretes at super-Eddington rate of $1.17\!-\!1.31~ \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ . Moreover, we find the mass and spin of the source as 12.44-13.09 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.990-0.997 with $90{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ confidence suggesting that GRS 1915+105 is a maximally rotating stellar mass X-ray binary black hole source."

The source was found to vary in the normal branch (NB) of the hardness-intensity diagram. Cross-correlation studies of LAXPC light curves in soft and hard X-ray band unveiled anticorrelated lags of the order of few hundred seconds. For the first time, cross-correlation studies were performed using SXT soft and LAXPC hard light curves and they exhibited correlated and anticorrelated lags of the order of a hundred seconds. Power density spectrum displayed normal branch oscillations (NBOs) of 6.7-7.8 Hz (quality factor 1.5-4.0). Spectral modelling resulted in inner disc radius of ∼12-16 km with Γ ∼ 2.31-2.44 indicating that disc is close to the innermost stable circular orbit and a similar value of disc radius was noticed based on the reflection model. Different methods were used to constrain the corona size in GX 17+2. Using the detected lags, corona size was found to be 27-46 km (β = 0.1, β = v<SUB>corona</SUB>/v<SUB>disc</SUB>) and 138-231 km (β = 0.5). Assuming the X-ray emission to be arising from the boundary layer (BL), its size was determined to be 57-71 km. Assuming that BL is ionizing the disc's inner region, its size was constrained to ∼19-86 km. Using NBO frequency, the transition shell radius was found to be around 32 km. Observed lags and no movement of the inner disc front strongly indicate that the varying corona structure is causing the X-ray variation in the NB of Z source GX 17+2."

The post-mass transfer systems with the presence of ELM WDs, including BSSs, are formed from Case A/B mass transfer and are unlikely to show any difference in surface abundances. We find a correlation between the temperature of the WD and the v sini of the BSSs. We also find that the progenitors of the massive WDs are likely to belong to the hot and luminous group of BSSs in M67.

Implementing a combination of multicolour disc model, relativistic blurred reflection model RELXILLLPCP, and a distant reflection in the form of XILLVERCP, we achieve reasonable and consistent fits for AstroSat and NuSTAR spectra.

X-ray pulsations at ≍604 s are clearly detected in our study. Based on the long-term spin-frequency evolution, the source is found to spun-up in the last 17 yr. We observed a strongly energy-dependent pulse profile that evolved from a complex broad structure in soft X-rays into a profile with a narrow emission peak followed by a plateau in energy ranges above 20 keV. This behaviour ensured a positive correlation between the energy and pulse fraction. The pulse profile morphology and its energy evolution are almost similar during both the observations, suggesting a persistent emission geometry of the pulsar over time. The broad-band energy spectrum of the pulsar is approximated by an absorbed high-energy exponential cut-off power-law model with iron emission lines. In contrast to the previous report, we found no statistical evidence for the presence of cyclotron absorption features in the X-ray spectra. We performed phase-resolved spectroscopy using data from the NuSTAR observation. Our results showed a clear signature of absorbing material at certain pulse phases of the pulsar. These findings are discussed in terms of stellar wind distribution and its effect on the beam geometry of this wind-fed accreting neutron star. We also reviewed the subsonic quasi-spherical accretion theory and its implication on the magnetic field of 4U 1909+07 depending on the global spin-up rate."

In particular, one needs to ascertain which variations of the parameters of the best-fitting time-averaged spectral components reproduce the observed energy-dependent fractional rms and time-lags. However, to obtain meaningful interpretation, the standard spectral component parameters have to be recast to physically relevant ones. Then, the energy-dependent temporal variations that their fluctuations will cause, needs to be predicted and compared with observations. In this work, we describe a generic method to do this and apply the technique to the ∼3-4 Hz QPOs observed in the black hole system GRS 1915+105 as observed by AstroSat where the time-averaged spectra can be represented by emission from a truncated disc and hot thermal Comptonizing coronae in the inner regions. We find that the QPOs and their harmonic can be explained in terms of correlated local accretion rate variations in the disc, the truncated disc radius, the optical depth and the heating rate of the coronae with time-delays between them. We highlight the potential of such techniques to unravel the radiative process responsible for variability using high-quality spectral and temporal data from AstroSat and NICER."

Pulsations having a periodicity of 9.29 s were detected for the first time by the NICER mission in the 0.2-10 keV energy band and, as reported here, by AstroSat over a broad energy band covering 0.3-80 keV. The pulsar exhibits a rapid spin-up during the outburst. Energy resolved folded pulse profiles are generated in several energy bands in 3-80 keV. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the timing and spectral characteristics of this Be binary pulsar in hard X-rays. There is suggestion of evolution of the pulse profile with energy. The energy spectrum of the pulsar is determined and from the best-fitting spectral values, the X-ray luminosity of RX J0209.6-7427 is inferred to be 1.6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>.

Light curves showed a strong pulsation of the pulsar with a period of 194.2201 ± 0.0016 s and a spin-up rate of (1.65 ± 0.06) × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Intermittent flaring was detected in light curves between the 3 and 80 keV energy bands, with an increase in intensity of up to 1.8 times its average intensity. Pulse profiles obtained between the 3 and 80 keV energy bands of the pulsar showed strong dependence on energy. During AstroSat observations, a broad peak was consistently observed in the power density spectrum of the source with a peak oscillation frequency of 0.090 Hz along with its higher harmonics, which may be due to quasi-periodic oscillations, a commonly observed phenomenon in transient X-ray pulsars during their outburst. AstroSat observations also detected cyclotron absorption features in its spectrum corresponding to (9.7-14.4) keV, (19.3-23.8) keV, and (37.8-43.1) keV. The pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source showed a phase-dependent variation in its energy and the relative strength of these features. The spectrum was well fitted with an absorbed blackbody, Fermi-Dirac cutoff model and alternatively with an absorbed CompTT model. Both of these models were combined with an Fe line and three Gaussian absorption lines to account for the observed cyclotron resonance scattering features in the spectrum."

We use light curves of length 30-90 ks from three to four epochs for all three blazars. We apply the autoregressive integrated moving average model, which indicates the variability is consistent with short memory processes for most of the epochs. We show that the power spectral density (PSDs) of the X-ray variabilities of the individual blazars are consistent within uncertainties across the epochs. This implies that the construction of broadband PSD using light curves from different epochs is accurate. However, using certain properties of the variance of the light curves and its segments, we show that the blazars exhibit hints of nonstationarity beyond that due to their characteristic red-noise nature in some of those observations. We find a linear relationship between the root-mean-squared amplitude of variability at shorter timescales and the mean flux level at longer timescales for light curves of Mrk 421 across epochs separated by decades as well as light curves spanning 5 days and ∼10 yr. The presence of a flux-rms relation over very different timescales may imply that, similar to the X-ray binaries and Seyfert galaxies, longer and shorter timescale variabilities are connected in blazars."

As wastewater treatment plants accumulate a large and diverse number of such species, we examined raw water samples taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant initially using SXT/R391 family integrase gene-specific PCR probes to detect the presence of such elements in a directed approach. A positive amplification occurred over a full year period and a subsequent Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis revealed a very limited diversity in the treatment plant examined. Samples demonstrating positive amplification were cultured using Vibrio and Proteus selective media and PCR amplification tracking was utilized to monitor SXT/R391-ICE family containing strains. This screening procedure resulted in the isolation and identification of a Proteus mirabilis strain harbouring an ICE. Whole-genome sequencing of this ICE containing strain using Illumina sequencing technology revealed a novel 81 kb element that contained 75 open reading frames on annotation but contained no antibiotic or metal resistance determinants. Comparative genomics revealed the element contained a conserved ICE core with one of the insertions containing a novel bacteriophage defence mechanism. This directed isolation suggests that ICE elements are present in the environment without apparent selective pressure but may contain adaptive functions allowing survival in particular environments such as municipal wastewater which are reservoirs for large bacterial phage populations."

In this work, we present the spectral and polarimetric analysis of the prompt emission of the burst using AstroSat, Fermi, and Niel Gehrels Swift observations. The prompt emission consists of two distinct emission episodes separated by a few seconds of quiescent/ mild activity period. The first emission episode shows a thermal component as well as a low polarization fraction of PF < 37 per cent at 1.5 σ confidence level. On the other hand, the second emission episode shows a non-thermal spectrum and is found to be highly polarized with PF > 43 per cent at 1.5σ confidence level. We also study the afterglow properties of the jet using Swift/XRT data. The observed jet break suggests that the jet is pointed towards the observer and has an opening angle of 1.2° for an assumed redshift, z = 2. With composite modelling of polarization, spectrum of the prompt emission, and the afterglow, we infer that the first episode of emission originates from the photosphere with localized dissipation happening below it, and the second from the optically thin region above the photosphere. The photospheric emission is generated mainly by inverse Compton scattering, whereas the emission in the optically thin region is produced by the synchrotron process. The low radiation efficiency of the burst suggests that the outflow remains baryonic dominated throughout the burst duration with only a subdominant Poynting flux component, and the kinetic energy of the jet is likely dissipated via internal shocks which evolves from an optically thick to optically thin environment within the jet."

It has long been known that a power-law electron distribution can be produced from a region where particles are accelerated under Fermi process and the radiative losses in acceleration site decide the maximum attainable Lorentz factor, γ<SUB>max</SUB>. Consequently, this quantity decides the energy at which the spectrum curves steeply.

This in turn provides an estimate of the acceleration time-scale as a function of magnetic field and Doppler factor.

We find that while the QPO frequency depends on the inner radii with a large scatter, a much tighter correlation is obtained when both the inner radii and accretion rate of the disk are taken into account. In fact, the frequency varies just as the dynamic frequency (I.e., the inverse of the sound crossing time) does as predicted decades ago by the relativistic standard accretion disk theory for a black hole with a spin parameter of ∼0.9.

The spectra at different sections of the Z-diagram are well described by either a combination of a thermal Comptonization component, a power-law and a relativistic iron line or a model consisting of a thermal disk component, a single temperature blackbody, a power-law and a relativistic iron line. Fitting the spectra with both phenomenological models suggests that the power-law component is strong in the horizontal branch (HB), becomes weaker as the source moves down the normal branch (NB) and then again becomes stronger as the sources moves up the flaring branch (FB). However, we find that the strength of the power-law component is model dependent, although the trend in the variation of the power-law strength along the Z-track is similar.

The irradiance was calculated using filter-ratio temperatures and emission measures (EMs) from the full-Sun integrated X-ray signals employing a coronal spectrum synthesized with CHIANTI atomic database version 8.0. Dependence of the results on the assumption of elemental abundances is investigated. The SXT irradiance for a shorter wavelength range was also calculated and compared with the low energy flux (0.1-0.8 nm) of the X-Ray Sensor on board the GOES satellite. To incorporate the spatial information of the observed corona, we tried the alternative method to derive irradiance by applying the filter-ratio method to the images of northern hemispheric corona instead of spatially integrated signals from there. The EM weighted average of the spatially resolved temperatures turned out to be generally 20%-30% lower than those derived from the integrated signals, while the total of spatially resolved EMs are accordingly 1.5-2 times higher. This trend is enhanced when solar activity is the lowest in early 1996. The irradiance obtained from the alternative method does not significantly vary from the result from the integrated signals. This provides some validation for the simpler full-Sun integrated method. The temporal variation of the EMs of cool (<1.5 MK), medium, and hot (>2.5 MK) components indicates that the ratio of the hot component relative to the medium component is higher in the ascending phase (mid 1998-2001) than in the descending phase (1992-1995) of the solar activity cycle."

We present its spectacular extraplanar tails of ionized and molecular gas, UV stellar light, and X-ray and radio continuum emission. This galaxy represents an excellent laboratory to study the interplay between different gas phases and star formation and the influence of gas stripping, gas heating, and AGNs. We analyze the physical origin of the emission at different wavelengths in the tail, in particular in situ star formation (related to Hα, CO, and UV emission), synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons (producing the radio continuum), and heating of the stripped interstellar medium (ISM; responsible for the X-ray emission). We show the similarities and differences of the spatial distributions of ionized gas, molecular gas, and UV light and argue that the mismatch on small scales (1 kpc) is due to different stages of the star formation process. We present the relation Hα-X-ray surface brightness, which is steeper for star-forming regions than for diffuse ionized gas regions with a high [O I]/Hα ratio. We propose that ISM heating due to interaction with the intracluster medium (either for mixing, thermal conduction, or shocks) is responsible for the X-ray tail, observed [O I] excess, and lack of star formation in the northern part of the tail. We also report the tentative discovery in the tail of the most distant (and among the brightest) currently known ULX, a pointlike ultraluminous X-ray source commonly originating in a binary stellar system powered by either an intermediate-mass black hole or a magnetized neutron star."

The QPO detected at ˜1.56 Hz drifts to a higher centroid frequency of ˜1.74 in the course of the observation, while the QPO detected at ˜6.6 Hz disappeared during hard flarings. The fractional rms at the QPO and the subharmonic frequencies increases with photon energy, while at the second harmonic frequencies the rms seems to be constant. In addition, we have observed soft time lag at QPO and subharmonic frequencies up to a timescale of ˜35 ms; however, at the second harmonic frequencies there is weak/zero time lag. We attempt spectral modeling of the broadband data in the 0.7-25 keV band using the doubly absorbed disk plus thermal Comptonization model. Based on the spectral and timing properties, we identified the source to be in the hard-intermediate state of black hole X-ray binaries.

The UV and UV-optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), along with overlaid isochrones, are presented for the member stars, which include blue straggler stars (BSSs), triple systems, white dwarfs (WDs), and spectroscopic binaries. The CMDs suggest the presence of excess UV flux in many members, which could be extrinsic or intrinsic to them. We construct multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using photometric data from the UVIT, Gaia DR2, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer surveys, along with optical photometry. We fitted model SEDs to seven WDs and find that four of them have mass >0.5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and cooling age of less than 200 Myr, thus demanding BSS progenitors. SED fits to 23 stars detect extremely low mass (ELM) WD companions to WOCS2007, WOCS6006, and WOCS2002 and a low-mass WD to WOCS3001, which suggest these to be post-mass transfer (MT) systems. Twelve sources with possible WD companions need further confirmation. Nine sources have X-ray and excess UV flux, possibly arising out of stellar activity. This study demonstrates that UV observations are key to detecting and characterizing the ELM WDs in nondegenerate systems, which are ideal test beds to explore the formation pathways of these peculiar WDs. The increasing detection of post-MT systems among BSSs and main-sequence stars suggests a strong MT pathway and stellar interactions in M67."

C.",,"In this biographical account, I recall my scientific journey that began in 1961 when I joined as a Physics Trainee in the BARC Training School and after one year course was admitted in TIFR as a Research Associate. During 1962-1967, I worked on determination of the He<SUP>3</SUP>/He<SUP>4</SUP> ratio in cosmic rays using a gas Cerenkov counter and also used a scintillation + solid Cerenkov detector to measure flux of protons and helium nuclei in primary cosmic rays. I also developed a large area scintillation-Cerenkov detector with a spark chamber between them for measuring charge composition of primary cosmic rays. I joined the X-ray astronomy programme in 1967 initiated by Prof. B. V. Sreekantan and played a leading role in developing a balloon borne hard X-ray instrument for studying time variability and energy spectra of cosmic X-ray sources. We carried out a series of balloon experiments and studied temporal intensity variation and energy spectra of X-ray objects like Sco X-1, Cyg X-1, etc. Results on rapid intensity changes and spectra appeared in a series of publications based on which I obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1972. Immediately afterwards, I joined Prof. Gordon Garmire at Caltech as a Research Fellow (a post-doctoral position) to work with him on the low energy component of HEAO A-2 experiment. The instrument was developed and successfully realised. Working on this satellite experiment was a thrilling experience which exposed me to the technical complexities of space instruments. The HEAO-1 satellite was launched in 1978. During 1978-1979, Guenter Riegler and I, working at JPL, reported detection of intense soft X-rays from several classes of extragalactic and Galactic objects like new BL Lacs, a new AM Her binary, coronal X-rays from active stars, etc. After returning to TIFR, I developed a rocket experiment with K. P. Singh to map the spatial and spectral distribution of the Soft Diffuse X-ray Background. At the same time, I also designed 15 cm deep Xenon filled Proportional Counters (XPCs) of ∼ 2500 cm<SUP>2</SUP> area for balloon experiments which were done during 1983-1990 and produced new results on several X-ray binaries. During this period I also developed a proportional counter (PC) based satellite instrument and submitted a proposal jointly with the astronomy group at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for an Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE). After success of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), the IXAE instrument was included on the top deck of the IRS-P3 satellite that was launched in March 1996. Despite the severe limitation of a polar orbit, the IXAE observed a good number of X-ray binaries and produced interesting results, with the most notable being quasi-regular bursts from a new transient, GRS 1915+105, which turned out to be an enigmatic black hole source. Following success of the IXAE, a proposal for an ambitious multiwavelength astronomy satellite, named ASTROSAT, with broad spectral coverage in the optical, NUV, FUV, soft X-ray and hard X-ray by a suite of instruments, was submitted to ISRO and finally approved by the Govt. of India in 2004. Over the next 10 years, the development and fabrication of the five ASTROSAT instruments were accomplished and a PSLV launch on Sept. 28, 2015 placed ASTROSAT in a 650 km circular orbit with 6 degree inclination. The ASTROSAT instruments have been performing well for ∼ 4 years and have observed more than 500 cosmic sources. Results from ASTROSAT have appeared in a large number of journal publications. Successful realization and performance of ASTROSAT marks culmination of my research career. I formally retired as a Senior Professor from TIFR on 2006 April 30 on attaining the age of superannuation. However by agreement with TIFR, ISRO designated me ‘ISRO Chair Professor’, which was later renamed as ISRO Satish Dhawan Professor, and asked me to continue to lead ASTROSAT as PI. At the end of my tenure as ISRO Professor on 2011 April 30, I relinquished the PI position. I am at present affiliated with the MU-DAE Centre of Excellence for Basic Sciences, Mumbai University Campus at Mumbai as an Emeritus Professor."

In the classification of variability classes of GRS 1915+105, at the start of the observation period the source was in class ω and at the end the variability was that of class μ: both classes are characterized by the absence of hard intervals and correspond to disc-dominated spectra. After normalization to take into account time variations of the spectral properties as measured by X-ray hardness, the QPO centroid frequency is observed to vary along the hardness-intensity diagram, increasing with hardness. We also measure phase lags that indicate that HFQPO variability at high energies lags that at lower energies and detect systematic variations with the position on the hardness-intensity diagram. This is the first time that (small) variations of the HFQPO frequency and lags are observed to correlate with other properties of the source. We discuss the results in the framework of existing models, although the small (7 per cent) variability observed is too small to draw firm conclusions."

Publicly available Swift monitoring observations in optical, ultraviolet and X-ray bands were used in the present work. A total of 185 pointings over a duration of about a month were used to understand the variabilities in emission in optical, ultraviolet, soft and hard X-ray bands. It was found that the source emission in the hard X-ray band (1.5-10 keV range) was highly variable compared to that at longer wavelengths. The variability amplitude decreased gradually from hard X-ray to optical bands. A cross-correlation analysis between light curves in different bands inferred that the observed variation in ultraviolet and optical bands is strongly correlated with the hard X-ray emission. Observed time lag for changes in emission in longer wavelength bands with respect to the hard X-ray emission suggests X-ray reprocessing as the cause of variation. Though the observed lag spectrum follows a 4/3rd power of wavelength, as predicted by the standard disk model, the estimated lags are found to be larger than the lags predicted from the standard disk model. This suggests that the actual disk in NGC 4593 is possibly larger than the standard thin disk. Though similar findings have been reported in NGC 5548 and Fairall 9, simultaneous near-infrared, ultraviolet, soft X-ray and hard X-ray band observations of a sample of AGNs with the 1.2 m telescope of Physical Research Laboratory at Mount Abu, India and first space-based multiwavelength observatory of India - AstroSat will provide significant information on the actual and model predicted sizes of the accretion disk."

On the one hand, the evolution of short period systems can be tremendously influenced by the companion, for instance through mass exchange or common envelope evolution. On the other hand, the wind-wind interaction region in massive multiple systems is the seat of a high level physics, including strong thermal X-ray emission, particle acceleration and non-thermal emission processes. The description and understanding of these processes require the accurate determination of orbital parameters, notably through spectroscopic studies. In this context, it is timely to anticipate some relevant applications of a high resolution spectrograph (HRS) to be mounted on the Devasthal Optical Telescope, emphasizing its potential complementarity with other Indian facilities such as the GMRT and Astrosat."

So far, the available measurements of hard X-ray polarization of GRB prompt emission have not significantly constrained the GRB models, particularly because of the difficulty of measuring polarization in these bands. The CZT Imager (CZTI) on board AstroSat is primarily an X-ray spectroscopic instrument that also works as a wide-angle GRB monitor due to the transparency of its support structure above 100 keV. It also has experimentally verified polarization measurement capability in the energy range 100-300 keV and thus provides a unique opportunity to attempt spectropolarimetric studies of GRBs. Here we present the polarization data for the brightest 11 GRBs detected by CZTI during its first year of operation. Among these, five GRBs show polarization signatures with ⪆3σ, and one GRB shows 2σ detection significance. We place upper limits for the remaining five GRBs.

The hardness-intensity plot reveals that the source traced out the horizontal and normal branches. The 0.8-20 keV spectra from simultaneous SXT and LAXPC data at different locations of the hardness-intensity plot can be described well by disk emission and a thermal Comptonized component. The ratio of the disk flux to the total flux, i.e., the disk flux ratio, increases monotonically along the horizontal branch to the normal one. Thus, the difference between the normal and horizontal branches is that in the normal branch, the disk dominates the flux while in the horizontal one it is the Comptonized component which dominates.

In the 3-20 keV LAXPC band, the r.m.s. of the QPO increases with energy (r.m.s. \propto {E}<SUP>0.8</SUP>), while the harder X-rays seem to lag the soft ones with a time-delay of milliseconds. The results suggest that the spectral properties of the source are characterized by the disk flux ratio and that the QPO has its origin in the corona producing the thermal Comptonized component."

Using our broad-band (1.3-70 keV) X-ray spectrum, we clearly show that a soft X-ray instrument, which works below 10-12 keV, alone cannot correctly characterize the Comptonizing component from the corona, thus highlighting the importance of broad-band spectral analysis. By fitting the reflection spectrum with the latest version of the RELXILL family of relativistic reflection models, we constrain the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter to be 0.67^{+0.16}_{-0.04}. We also jointly use the reflection spectral component (RELXILL) and a general relativistic thin disc component (Kerrbb), and estimate the black hole's mass and distance to be 10.39_{-0.62}^{+0.61} M_{\odot } and 5.4_{-1.1}^{+1.8} kpc, respectively."

The spectral modelling using nthComp gives a photon index in the range 2.18-2.37 and electron temperature ranging from 21 to 63 keV. The seed photon temperature is within 0.19 to 0.29 keV.

The light curve consisted of a flare at the beginning of the observation, followed by persistent emission. The pulsar continues to spin down, and the pulse profile is found to be double-peaked up to 16 keV with the peaks separated by a phase of ∼0.45. Significant energy dependence of the pulse profile is seen with diminishing amplitude of the secondary peak above 16 keV, and increasing amplitude of the main peak up to 40 keV with a sharp decline after that. We confirm earlier detections of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) in 4U 1907+09 at ∼18.5 ± 0.2 keV in the phase-averaged spectrum with a high detection significance. An intensity resolved spectral analysis of the initial flare in the light curve shows that the CRSF parameters do not change with a change in luminosity by a factor of 2.6. We also performed pulse phase-resolved spectral analysis with 10 independent phase bins. The energy and the strength of the cyclotron line show pulse phase dependence that is in agreement with previous measurements. Two features from the current observation (different energy dependence of the two pulse peaks and a strong CRSF only around the secondary peak) both indicate a deviation from a dipole geometry of the magnetic field of the neutron star, or complex beaming pattern from the two poles."

In this paper, we point out that x-ray pulsars with higher photon energies and smaller source sizes are good candidate sources for microlensing for this mass window. Among the existing x-ray pulsars, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) X-1 source is found to be the best candidate because of its apparent brightness and long distance from Earth. We have analyzed the existing observation data of SMC X-1 by the RXTE telescope (around 10 days) and found that PBH as 100% of dark matter is close to but not yet excluded. Future longer observation of this source by x-ray telescopes with larger effective areas such as AstroSat, Athena, Lynx, and eXTP can potentially close the last mass window where PBHs can make up all of dark matter."

The event mode data from LAXPC provides unprecedented energy dependent fractional root mean square (rms) and time-lag at different frequencies which we fit with empirical functions. We invoke a fluctuation propagation model for a simple geometry of a truncated disc with a hot inner region. Unlike other propagation models, the hard X-ray emission (>4 keV) is assumed to be from the hot inner disc by a single-temperature thermal Comptonization process. The fluctuations first cause a variation in the temperature of the truncated disc and then the temperature of the inner disc after a frequency dependent time delay. We find that the model can explain the energy dependent rms and time-lag at different frequencies."

We analyzed repeated plasma samples in a cohort of malaria-exposed Ugandan WLHIV receiving ART and daily TMP/SXT to examine changes in inflammatory markers across pregnancy and their association with birth outcomes. Concentrations of CHI3L1, CRP, IL-18BP, IL-6, sICAM-1, and sTNFR2 were quantified by ELISA in 1115 plasma samples collected over pregnancy from 326 women. MiP was associated with increased sTNFR2, sICAM-1 and IL-18BP concentrations across pregnancy. Women who delivered preterm had elevated concentrations of sTNFR2 and altered levels of IL-6 during pregnancy. Women with sTNFR2 concentrations in the highest quartile within 6 weeks of delivery had an increased relative risk of preterm birth. Our results indicate that despite daily TMP/SXT, MiP in WLHIV induced a systemic inflammatory response that was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. These findings highlight the need for additional strategies to protect WLHIV from malaria infection in pregnancy to promote healthy outcomes for mother and child."

We have observed this cluster with the AstroSat-UltraViolet Imaging Telescope in two far-UV (FUV) and five near-UV (NUV) filters, respectively. These UV filters enable the identification of HB populations of stars. The results from four NUV filters exhibit bimodal distributions in magnitude histograms. The nature of bimodality has been investigated on the basis of distinct stellar types contributing to those bands. The colour-magnitude diagrams constructed using FUV and NUV filters enable the location of hot stellar populations, viz. stars belonging to red HB (RHB), blue HB, extreme HB, blue hook branch, and post-asymptotic giant branch. Prominent gaps are observed in the UV colour-magnitude diagrams. We report for the first time a photometric gap in an NUV colour-magnitude diagram that segregates the RHB population of this cluster into two groups that are likely to be associated with distinct generations of stars. We also investigate the spatial density distributions of various groups of stars in the cluster and comment on the proposed formation models of multiple populations."

High-resolution genotyping of L. pneumophila isolates can be achieved by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA-8). Legionella infections in humans occur as a result of inhalation of bacteria-containing aerosols, thus, our aim was to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of different MLVA-8 genotypes to ten commonly used antimicrobial agents in legionellosis therapy. Epidemiological cut-off values were determined for all antibiotics. Significant differences were found between the antimicrobial agents' susceptibilities of the three studied environmental genotypes (Gt4, Gt6, and Gt15). Each genotype exhibited a significantly different susceptibility profile, with Gt4 strains (Sequence Type 1) significantly more resistant towards most studied antimicrobial agents. In contrast, Gt6 strains (also Sequence Type 1) were more susceptible to six of the ten studied antimicrobial agents compared to the other genotypes. Our findings show that environmental strains isolated from adjacent points of the same water system, exhibit distinct antimicrobial resistance profiles. These differences highlight the importance of susceptibility testing of Legionella strains. In Israel, the most extensively used macrolide for pneumonia is azithromycin. Our results point at the fact that clarithromycin (another macrolide) and trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole (SXT) were the most effective antimicrobial agents towards L. pneumophila strains. Moreover, legionellosis can be caused by multiple L. pneumophila genotypes, thus, the treatment approach should be the use of combined antibiotic therapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate specific antimicrobial combinations for legionellosis therapy."

The prompt emission from GRB 171010A was very bright (fluence >10<SUP>-4</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) and had a complex structure that was composed of the superimposition of several pulses. The energy spectra deviate from the typical Band function to show a low-energy peak ∼15 keV, which we interpret as a power law with two breaks, with a synchrotron origin. Alternatively, the prompt spectra can also be interpreted as Comptonized emission, or a blackbody combined with a Band function. A time-resolved analysis confirms the presence of the low-energy component, while the peak energy is found to be confined in the range of 100-200 keV. The afterglow emission detected by Fermi-LAT is typical of an external shock model, and we constrain the initial Lorentz factor using the peak time of the emission. Swift-XRT measurements of the afterglow show an indication for a jet break, allowing us to constrain the jet opening angle to <6°. The detection of a large number of Compton-scattered events by AstroSat-CZTI provides an opportunity to study the hard X-ray polarization of the prompt emission. We find that the burst has a high time-variable polarization, and the emission has a higher polarization at energies above the peak energy. We discuss all observations in the context of GRB models and polarization arising as a result of physical or geometric effects: synchrotron emission from multiple shocks with ordered or random magnetic fields, a jet dominated by Poynting flux that undergoes abrupt magnetic dissipation, subphotospheric dissipation, a jet consisting of fragmented fireballs, and the Comptonization model."

The main bright kernels of the flare occurred at the centre of the active region near magnetic neutral line, after that the flare ribbons appeared along it. It was found that HXR coronal source was located along a magnetic polarity inversion line of the active region. EUV loop structures indicate the observational evidence of a magnetic reconnection during the main phase of the flare."

The UV and UV-optical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are constructed by combining the UVIT, HST-ACS and ground data and are compared with the Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones (BaSTI) isochrones generated for UVIT filters. We used stellar proper motion data from GAIA DR2 to select the cluster members. Our estimations of the temperature distribution of 110 BHB stars reveal two peaks, with the main peak at T<SUB>eff</SUB> ˜ 10 300 K, and with the distribution extending up to T<SUB>eff</SUB> ˜ 18 000 K. We identify the well-known photometric gaps, including the Grundahl jump (G-jump) in the BHB distribution, which are located between the peaks. We detect a plateau in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) magnitude for stars hotter than T<SUB>eff</SUB> ˜ 11 500 K (G-jump), which could be caused by atomic diffusion. We detect two extreme horizontal branch (EHB) candidates, with temperatures ranging from 29 000 to 32 000 K. The radial distribution of 68 BSSs suggests that the bright BSSs are more centrally concentrated than the faint BSSs and the BHB stars. We find that the BSSs have a mass range of 0.86-1.25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and an age range of 2-10 Gyr, with peaks at 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 4 Gyr respectively. This study showcases the importance of combining UVIT with HST, ground and GAIA data in deriving HB and BSS properties."
87,Study of Timing Evolution from Nonvariable to Structured Large-amplitude Variability Transition in GRS 1915 + 105 Using AstroSat,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870....4R,['GRS 1915+105'],"Rawat, D., Pahari, M., Yadav, J.

K.","accretion, accretion disks, black hole physics, X-rays: binaries, X-rays: individual: GRS 1915 + 105 LAXPC&amp;AstroSat, Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","In this work, we present a ∼90 ks continuous monitoring of the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915 + 105 with AstroSat when the source undergoes a major transition from a nonvariable, χ class (similar to radio-quiet χ class) to a structured, large-amplitude, periodic heartbeat state (similar to ρ class). We show that such a transition takes place via an intermediate state when the large-amplitude, irregular variability of the order of hundreds of seconds in the soft X-ray band turned into 100-150 s regular, structured, nearly periodic flares. The properties of strong low-frequency (LF) quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the frequency range 3-5 Hz also evolve marginally during these variability transitions. We also study time-lag and rms spectra at the QPO and harmonic component and the dynamic power spectra. We note a few important differences between the heartbeat state and the ρ class. Interestingly, the time-averaged LF QPO properties in the hard X-ray band are relatively stable in three states when compared to the significant evolution observed in the slow variability properties at millihertz frequencies. Such relative stability of LF QPOs implies that the inner disk-corona coupled accretion flow, which determines the LF QPO properties, may be uninterrupted by the launch of long, large-amplitude flares."
